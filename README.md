We live in wonderful times... Now is possible for us to get wonderful, old and used measurement equipment on e-bay, just for a few bucks. Equipment that otherwise would be out of  the hobbist leage, like 6.5 digit multimeters, oscilloscopes, signal generators... just to name a few.

These old equipment often come with a GPIB interface, which allows to control them from a computer with the corresponding GPIB connection. Regretably, computers do not come with GPIB interfaces, and the adapters available are not cheap.

Here comes this little device to rescue. It is a gpib-to-usb adapter which after connected to the computer via the almighty usb port, it presents itself as a serial port and allows to send GPIB commands to connected GPIB devices.

For now is yet a work in progress. So wait for updates.
